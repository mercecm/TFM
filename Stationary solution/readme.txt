In the folder "Uniform mesh", different trials performed with uniform elements in the mesh. In the folder "Variable mesh", same trials performed with a transformation applied to the mesh to have higher density of nodes near x = 0.

In the name of the pictures, number of elements in grid are indicated: 10 or 100. 1 and 2 indicate the degree of the finite element defined in the function space.

In csv files are stored: x coordinate, u computed,u exact,flux computed,flux exact

concentrations.gnuplot and flux.gnuplot generate plots with the different trials overlapped.
